Hi! I'm a medical technologist in molecular biology with experience in high complexity diagnostics and an aspiring web developer. Working in a clinical laboratory has taught patience, efficiency, and attention to detail that has helped me analyze patient samples and deliver high quality and accurate results. I recently gained an interest in web development and explored a fundamentals bootcamp through NuCamp. I continued with a Full Stack Web Development course through Udemy and am continuing to learn every day. Both fields require a lifetime commitment to learning and are critical in keeping up with new technologies and techniques in our ever changing, fast-paced market. I hope to combine both disciplines as I advance in my career.
